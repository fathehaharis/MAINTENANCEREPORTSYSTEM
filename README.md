To address these shortcomings, this project proposes the development of a Maintenance Report System with Image-Based Evidence. This web-based system is designed to enhance the entire maintenance reporting workflow. It will enable facilities staff to submit reports that include not only textual descriptions, but also vital multimedia evidence, such as photographs and short video clips of the issue. By providing administrators with clear, visual information, the system aims to eliminate ambiguity, facilitate faster diagnosis, and enable more accurate allocation of repair resources. Ultimately, the goal is to establish a transparent, accountable, and highly efficient communication bridge between the individual reporting issues and the administration responsible for resolving them
